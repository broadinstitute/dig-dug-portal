/* Color Space Function
 If we don't know what color something should be ahead of time, but we want the color to be standardized across different parts of the interface,
 BUT, we know roughly how many colors we need, we can create a colorClosure which can create our color scheme for us on the fly.

    // * If you want a color, you'll get a color â€“ no backsies or deletions.
    // * The colorSpaceSize needs to be sufficiently close to the size of the domain for your colors
    //   * If the colorSpaceSize is not large enough to accomodate all the colors you need, 
    //     it will resize further, at the expense of recoloring the interface (flicker).
    //   * If the colorSpaceSize is too large, then your colors will bias to a certain part of the spectrum and won't distinguish from each other well.
    // * All colors are meant to be unique and without repetition.
    // * The color space is first-come, first-serve and thus allowed to be path-dependent (it's OK for a tissue to have different colors in different sessions)
