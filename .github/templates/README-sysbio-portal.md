# SysBio Portal Code

This repository contains the code for the SysBio Portal, automatically synced from the source repository.

**Please do not make direct edits here.** Changes should be made in the source repository. If hotfixes are needed, please do PRs. Contact the maintainers for any questions. This is WIP repo, and depends on how things progress, auto-sync might be disabled in favor of manual review in the future if needed.

To change the default data sources, you can change its environment variables. For example, if you want to change the volcano plot to a different data source (in the gene expression browser), you can set the environment variable `VUE_APP_VOLCANO_DATASET_URL` to desired path at runtime.

For a list of all available environment variables, see [Environment Variables](DOCKER_README.md#environment-variables).

To run: `npm install`, then `npm run deploy`

The output will be in the `portals/SysBio` directory, ready to be served by any webserver.
